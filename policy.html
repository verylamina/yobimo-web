                    Our label policy is there in general so that you know how we process your demo/tracks, how we handle distribution, what's your right as an artist or
                    individual, revenue sharing, copyright, and other important aspects. The policy is there so that we can remain transparent, fair, and have a safe
                    environment for all artists.
