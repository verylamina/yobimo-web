# Label Policy

The Label Policy is our set of rules and regulations when submitting, joining, or engaging in various events within Yobimo (e.g., demo submission, event registration,
Music Contest). In this policy, we will cover our artists' rights, the label's rights, as well as its terms and conditions. The label policy will be
applied for all projects that Yobimo will conduct. Therefore, we expect our artists to comply with diligence and responsibility. 

## 1) Intellectual Property

The Intellectual Property refers to anything that you created, through the form of music, an art, video, multimedia or program. Yobimo Entertainment holds and own any form of materials, whether physical or digital, including music, video, animation, and any other forms of multimedia published under Yobimo. Yobimo, as the owner of the aforementioned,
reserves the right to remove or alter its contents <b>with or without notice</b> in a reasonable manner.

Artists have the <b>rights to remove or alter</b> their materials. In the form of modifying the contents of their materials, we only allow <b>one (1) change</b> per month. Excessive altering of the contents' material may result in removal without prior warning.

Any materials published by Yobimo may be used by another group or organization only for the purpose of <b>promotion</b>, as long as they attribute both the original owner/artist of the material and Yobimo. Nonetheless, any materials published by Yobimo cannot be redistributed, sold, or used by a third-party company in any form without permission from both Yobimo and the owner of the material.

## 2) Artists' Rights

Artists are free to participate in any events in and out of Yobimo, regardless if they have signed the contract or agreed to the label policy or not. Artists who agree to the label policy are expected to abide by the guidelines contained within it, as well as practicing proper behavior both in public and within Yobimo. We strongly advise artists against bringing up sensitive topics that could damage their own or the label's reputation. 

Artists who have agreed to this label policy have the right to withdraw from this policy, and Yobimo is entitled to seek information regarding the artists' justification for the said withdrawal. However, once an artist withdraws from this policy, all of their materials published under Yobimo will be removed and the full rights will be given to the said artist, while also completely removing their personal data from Yobimo after withdrawal. All materials that are made by Yobimo are not included in the transferred rights, in which Yobimo will retain its rights to those materials (ex. Album cover art, MV, etc.)

## 3) Material Publishing

A material refers to any type of media form to be published under Yobimo for digital streaming, and to earn royalties from it. Before any material is published by Yobimo, it must be reviewed by the Evaluation Team. Artists can submit the following: <b>audio, video, images, and other multimedia assets (such as sample packs) as long as they can be distributed digitally</b>. Each media requires different standards to be followed before it can be distributed.


### Audio
- The audio material must be original and entirely created by the author. Third-party plugins, sample packs, or any other content used in the audio must be royalty-free. If an audio includes/includes vocals/lyrical composition, consent is required from the songwriter/vocalist. Any audio that contains any form of harmful content that could harass, expose an individual or a particular organization, or even the label itself are prohibited.

### Video (MV) and Images
- The video material must be original along with its assets. Assets that were used or taken from a third-party organization or company must be royalty-free. Materials that contain contents that could harm, harass, or expose an individual or a particular organization, or even the label itself are also prohibited.

The distribution process of the material may take one (1) to two (2) weeks before it will be available to the public. The distribution must not take longer than one month, or else the material will be on-hold for follow-up.

Any revisions requested by the author will only be implemented two weeks following the publication date of the content. Yobimo has the right to properly alter sections of the material's metadata at an organization or individual’s request.

Yobimo's official distributor also has the right to remove the material without prior notice. In such cases, it must be reported to the original author. The cause of the removal of the material must also be informed to the said author.

Any request of removal of material will be considered as long as the material is atleast one (1) month old. Materials that are published in less than one (1) month are not subject for request for removal unless requested by the distributor or legal organization.

## Royalties

Before artists receive their royalties, one material must reach between $50 (or ₱2,500) and $200 (₱10,000) worth of total sales, and the material must be distributed and published live within 2 months. Material that is made only by one individual will be granted the full *70% of the generated royalty sales, while material that is made by two or more people or parties will be split within that *70%.

### Royalty Splits Info
- Artists or individuals : <b>*70% of the generated sales/album</b>
- Yobimo Entertainment (including taxes) : <b>*15% of the generated sales/album</b>
- Distribution fee : <b>*15% of the generated sales/album</b>

<sub> * Please take note that there may be adjustments to the royalty splits. Any changes to this royalty split by Yobimo must be clearly disclosed to the artists. Any changes to that split will only be reflected in the next payout

Paypal or any authorized bank account is required in order to receive the artists' royalties. Please take note that Paypal's transfer fees vary depending on the amount. The lesser the amount, the greater the transfer fee. The threshold for royalties ensures that these transfer fees are at a convenient and efficient rate for all parties. For artists residing in the Philippines, GCash and GoTyme or any other local bank are allowed as alternatives. 

Artists who withdraw from the label (or are terminated) will only get 25-50% of the generated sales. If the artist has been terminated due to unlawful actions, Yobimo reserves the authority to completely terminate the artist's overall sales, therefore, their general sales will become *terminated sales. 

<sub>*Terminated sales are any generated sales that were either closed by Yobimo in a legal manner or cannot be transferred to Yobimo. These sales are instead used for charitable purposes.</sub>

*Statement of account will be provided and generated once every six months. History of account will not be provided.

<sub>*Statement of account is not available for now.</sub>

Yobimo must provide an official receipt to the artists who will be receiving the royalties. The receipt must include information about the generated sales, such as what album or material is included within those sales, along with taxes. Any hidden transaction is strictly prohibited.

## Data Collection
Yobimo will follow the Data Privacy Act of 2013 (R.A. 10173). Each artists are required to submit their personal information for records and metadata purposes. Personal information must be treated with confidentiality and shall not be disclosed to anyone unless required by law.

Artists who will withdraw from Yobimo will have all of their personal information be deleted from its local database. Once their data is deleted, it cannot be retrieved again.

## Termination Process
Termination (or ban) will only be implemented if an artist does an action that does not follow Yobimo's label policy. This may result in all of their published materials under Yobimo to be taken down.

Artists who were terminated will not be able to sign or submit any materials to Yobimo.

If the artist is officially dismissed, a termination letter must be written and sent to them. The artist has the right to respond to this notice and explain his or her side. If Yobimo believes they made the wrong decision, the administration team shall launch an additional investigation into the artist's unlawful action or the basis for their termination.

If founded guilty or advised with a special power of an attorney, the artist can no longer respond to his or her termination and will be officially terminated. Making any unlawful action to any of Yobimo's clients, including artists, that may affect our clients' overall wellbeing is strictly prohibited.
